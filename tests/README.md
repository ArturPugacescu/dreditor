# Writing QUnit tests

As we write tests for the js code in the src tree we mimic it's structure same as Drupal 8 does.

## Directories

- lib/ contains needed libraries like qunit
- artifacts/ contains replicas from drupal.org like nodes and users
- src/js where the js tests are following the same tree structure
